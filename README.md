# MD-SSR-BLOG

Work in progress!

## What is this?

**M**ark**d**own **S**erver **S**ide **R**endered Blog

This is a blog webapp that takes Markdown files and serves them as HTML via server side rendering, without the need for a build step. That means you can push your Markdown files directly to a directory and it will be available for reading immediately.

## (Planned) Features
- Publish blog posts as markdown files directly without a build step
- Home page with pagination that shows all available blog posts
